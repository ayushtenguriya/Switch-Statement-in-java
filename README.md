# Switch-Statement-in-java

switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

This is how it works:
The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
